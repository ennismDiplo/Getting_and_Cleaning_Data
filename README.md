# Getting_and_Cleaning_Data
Coursera Getting and Cleaning Data Project

The R script, run_analysis.R, for the Cousera Getting and Cleaning Data Project, does the following:

Downloads the dataset

Loads the activity and feature data

Loads the training and test datasets, keeping only the columns are means and/or standard deviations

Loads the activity and subject data for each dataset, and merges those columns with the dataset

Merges the two datasets

Converts the activity and subject columns into factors

Creates a tidy dataset that consists of the average (mean) value of each variable for each subject and activity pair.

The result is seen in the file tidy_data_set.txt.
